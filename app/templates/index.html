  <h1>Hello, World. I'm Sarah.</h1>
  <p>I'm a front-end developer currently based in Seattle, WA. I work mostly with Javascript, CSS/SASS, and HTML, but I also enjoy Python, I can muck about with PHP, and in the past I've flirted with Java and Ruby. After working for <a href="https://www.monkee-boy.com/">Monkee-Boy Web Design</a> (check out their footer banana) in Austin, TX, I decided to take a year off to travel the world and pick up some more languages spoken by humans instead of computers.</p>
  <p>Now that <a href="http://thelongtrip.org/">that particular trip</a> is over, I'm back to coding full-time and attempting to make up for a year of sparse github contributions. This portfolio is a selection of client and personal work I've done over the past few years. Oh, and it's also <a href="https://github.com/smhigley/portfolio">on github</a>.</p>
